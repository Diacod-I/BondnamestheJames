This is merely a practice repository for learning how to work with Gephi graph tool and use the Networkx module in Python.<br><br>
Gephi is a very useful tool to create graph data structures and make it easy to visualize and get incredible insights on networks like social networks, neuron networks etc.<br><br>
As someone who is very interested in neuroscience, it is necessary for me to know how to understand networks.
